This is a small story of a small rat
There was a small rat in a big forest
It always roamed around the forest freely
One day while it was enjoying its walk in the forest,
a small thorn pricked in its tail.
It felt a lot of pain
The rat was not able to remove that thorn

Will you help the rat in removing its thorn ?
